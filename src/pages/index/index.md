    title: "What is a hackathon anyway?"
    description: "Hackathons are events where people from multiple disciplines can team up to create a quick and demonstrable version of their project. The teams compete to see which project will be deemed the best by experts in the industry and can win prizes! Hackathons are often themed around a certrain topic, but can often be freeform! Our society aims to provide some mini-hacks and similar events throughout the year with our big 24-hour hackathon being held in February."

    title: "What will the event be like?"
    description: "Building from our Hackathon last year, we're aiming to put our Alumni prize award towards equipping our hardware lab for Hackathon attendees to make use of. Some of the hardware will include low-power microcontrollers and potentially some Virtual Reality equipment! Last year's event had some very solid entries, to the point where it was difficult to choose the overall best, so definitely come down and make something you can boast about on your CV!"
